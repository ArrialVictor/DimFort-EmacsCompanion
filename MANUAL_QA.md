# Manual QA — DimFort Emacs companion

A precise visual smoke test to run **before tagging a release**. It
checks the parts only a human can see in the editor; the server's
verdicts are unit-tested upstream, so this deliberately does *not*
re-verify them. The Neovim and VSCode companions carry the same
checklist with their own commands — running all three confirms the
companions stay in parity.

Every step lists the **exact** expected result. Anything that differs
is a regression to file.

## Scene

Save this as `qa.f90` and open it. It is self-contained (one module,
no cross-file `use`) and fires exactly one of each interesting
diagnostic.

```fortran
module qa_mod
  real, parameter :: c_sound = 340.0   !< @unit{m/s}
  real :: ref_pressure                 !< @unit{Pa}
contains
  function dynamic_pressure(v) result(q)
    real, intent(in) :: v    !< @unit{m/s}
    real             :: q    !< @unit{Pa}
    real             :: rho  !< @unit{kg/m^3}
    rho = 1.225
    q = 0.5 * rho * v * v
  end function dynamic_pressure

  subroutine checks()
    real :: t          !< @unit{s}
    real :: d          !< @unit{m}
    real :: bogus      !< @unit{kg}
    real :: t_celsius                  ! no annotation -> U005
    d         = c_sound * t            ! OK:   m = (m/s)*s
    bogus     = c_sound * t            ! H001: kg = m  (mismatch)
    t_celsius = t - 273.15             ! H010: bare 273.15 literal
    ref_pressure = dynamic_pressure(c_sound)
  end subroutine checks
end module qa_mod
```

Start the server: `M-x eglot`. Give the first workspace check a moment
to finish, then walk the sections below.

## Defaults (fresh config)

- [ ] No `[unit]` inlay ghost text anywhere — inlays are off by default.
- [ ] The **side panel opens automatically** on the right once the server
      attaches — it's on by default.
- [ ] `M-x dimfort-status` prints **exactly** this:

      ```
      DimFort status
        executable        : dimfort
        inlay hints       : off
        completion        : on
        code actions      : on
        go-to-definition  : on
        hover             : disabled
        cache             : read-write
        cache dir         : (default)
        max workset size  : 40
        external modules  : (none)
      ```

## Diagnostics

In Emacs (flymake), an **error** renders the offending text in **bold
red** with red `!!` in the left fringe; a **warning** renders in **bold
orange** with a single orange `!`. On a fresh open, confirm exactly:

- [ ] **Line 17** — `t_celsius` (no annotation) → **U005 warning**: the
      name `t_celsius` in bold orange, orange `!` in the fringe.
- [ ] **Line 19** — `bogus = c_sound * t` → **H001 error** `kg ≠ m`: the
      whole assignment in bold red, red `!!` in the fringe.
- [ ] **Line 20** — `t_celsius = t - 273.15` → **H010 warning** on the
      `273.15` literal (suggests extracting it to a named PARAMETER).
- [ ] Lines 18 and 21 are **clean** — no diagnostic (the assignments are
      unit-consistent).

**Interactive — U002 (unparseable annotation):** change line 14's
`!< @unit{s}` to `!< @unit{??}` and save (`C-x C-s`). Confirm **two**
diagnostics on line 14, then undo (`C-/`):

- [ ] A **U002 error** underlining the `@unit{??}` token itself (not the
      start of the line).
- [ ] A **U005 warning** on `t` itself — because an unparseable annotation
      makes `t` count as unannotated. (In the panel, `t` flips to 🔴.)

## Hover

Hover is **disabled by default** (the panel is the unit surface). Enable
it to test: `M-x dimfort-cycle-hover` cycles `disabled → short →
detailed`, restarting the server each time. Point at the symbol; eldoc
shows in the echo area (or open a window with `M-x eldoc-doc-buffer`).

- [ ] **Disabled (default)** — hovering a symbol shows nothing.
- [ ] **Short** — cycle once to `short`. On **`c_sound`**:

      ```
      🟢 DimFort
      c_sound : m/s
      ```

      and on the product `c_sound * t` (line 18), one compact line:

      ```
      🟢 DimFort
      c_sound * t : m
      ```

- [ ] **Detailed** — cycle once more to `detailed`. The same product now
      breaks down across lines:

      ```
      🟢 DimFort
      c_sound * t : m
        🟢  c_sound : m/s
        🟢  t       : s
      ```

      and the **call** `dynamic_pressure` (line 21) shows the
      formal-vs-actual pairing:

      ```
      🟢 DimFort
      dynamic_pressure : Pa
        🟢  v : m/s   ◂   c_sound : m/s
      ```

- [ ] Cycle once more → back to `disabled`; hovers go silent again.

## Inlay hints

- [ ] `M-x dimfort-toggle-inlay-hints` → `[m/s]`-style ghost text appears
      after variable uses. Run it again → the ghost text disappears.

## Code actions

`M-x eglot-code-actions` with point on the relevant line.

- [ ] On `t_celsius` (line 17) → **"add `@unit{}`"**. Applying inserts
      `!< @unit{}` and leaves point **between the braces**.
- [ ] On the `273.15` (line 20) → **"extract literal to PARAMETER"**.
      Applying prompts for a name, then inserts a typed `real, parameter`
      declaration and replaces the `273.15` with the new name.

## Navigation & completion

- [ ] `M-.` (`xref-find-definitions`) on a `c_sound` use → jumps to its
      declaration on line 2.
- [ ] Type a new `!< @unit{` and invoke completion (`C-M-i`) → unit names
      are offered.

## Side panel

`M-x dimfort-panel-toggle` opens it on the right. The panel follows the
cursor (≈0.2 s debounce) and dims briefly while it refreshes.

- [ ] **Assignment with a mismatch** — put point on the **`=`** in line 19
      (`bogus = c_sound * t`). The whole assignment renders, marked 🔴
      because `kg ≠ m`:

      ```
      Expression

      bogus = c_sound * t        🔴
      ├── bogus           : kg   🟢
      └── c_sound * t     : m    🟢 (R4.2)
          ├── c_sound     : m/s  🟢
          └── t           : s    🟢
      ```

- [ ] **Multiplication chain** — point on the **`=`** in line 10
      (`q = 0.5 * rho * v * v`). The product nests, each step tagged with
      its rule:

      ```
      q = 0.5 * rho * v * v              🟢
      ├── q                 : kg/(m×s²)  🟢
      └── 0.5 * rho * v * v : kg/(m×s²)  🟢 (R4.2)
          ├── 0.5 * rho * v : kg/(m²×s)  🟢 (R4.2)
          │   ├── 0.5 * rho : kg/m³      🟢 (R4.2)
          │   │   ├── 0.5   : 1          🟢
          │   │   └── rho   : kg/m³      🟢
          │   └── v         : m/s        🟢
          └── v             : m/s        🟢
      ```

- [ ] **Function call with arguments** — point on the call name
      `dynamic_pressure` in line 21. The call resolves to its result unit
      and lists each argument as a child:

      ```
      dynamic_pressure(c_sound) : kg/(m×s²)  🟢
      └── c_sound               : m/s        🟢
      ```

- [ ] **Stacked scopes** — with point in line 10 (inside the function),
      the Scope section stacks the module over the function, indented by
      nesting (no column header — the row is `line · name · unit · mark`):

      ```
      Module: qa_mod

        2     c_sound       m/s  🟢
        3     ref_pressure  Pa   🟢

        Function: dynamic_pressure

          6     v     m/s    🟢
          7     q     Pa     🟢
          8     rho   kg/m^3 🟢
      ```

- [ ] **Markers** — in `checks` (e.g. point in line 19), `t_celsius` shows
      🟡 (unannotated). With a `@unit{??}` somewhere in scope, that
      variable shows 🔴 (annotated but unparseable).

- [ ] **Cursor-follow** — move point between line 10 (function) and line 19
      (subroutine); the Scope section switches between `Function:
      dynamic_pressure` and `Subroutine: checks` accordingly.
